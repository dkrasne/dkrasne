### About Me

I received a PhD in Classics in 2011 from UC Berkeley and an MS degree in Data Analytics & Visualization (with specializations in Digital Humanities and spatial analysis & design) in 2025 from the Pratt Institute's School of Information. I primarily code in Python, but I also know R and have taught myself some JavaScript and D3.js.

Feel free to take a look at [my portfolio](http://pratt.darcykrasne.com/Portfolio/)! It's a combination of standard data viz and Digital Humanities projects.
