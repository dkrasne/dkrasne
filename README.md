### Hi!

Although I have a PhD in Classics, I'm now studying for an MS degree in data analytics & visualization, with specializations in Digital Humanities and spatial analysis and visualization. I primarily code in Python, but I also know R and have taught myself some JavaScript and D3.js.

Feel free to take a look at [my portfolio](http://pratt.darcykrasne.com/Portfolio/)!
